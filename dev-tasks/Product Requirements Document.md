# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a Task Management Single Page Application (SPA) built with React, TypeScript, Chakra UI, and Vite. The application enables users to create, view, edit, and manage tasks with a focus on usability, accessibility, and robust state management.

## Goals

- Provide a simple, intuitive interface for managing personal tasks
- Ensure accessibility and responsive design
- Guarantee data persistence and reliability
- Support robust error handling and user feedback
- Maintain high code quality and test coverage

## User Stories

- **As a user,** I want to view a list of my tasks so that I can see what I need to do.
- **As a user,** I want to search and filter the list of my tasks matching by name and description so that I can find a specific task.
- **As a user,** I want to archive completed tasks so that I can hide completed tasks from my task list.
- **As a user,** I want to be able to filter my task list by archived and non-archived so that I can see a history of all completed tasks.
- **As a user,** I want to create new tasks so that I can keep track of new to-dos.
- **As a user,** I want to edit existing tasks so that I can update details or mark them as complete.
- **As a user,** I want to delete tasks I no longer need.
- **As a user,** I want to see loading indicators and error messages so I know the status of my actions.
- **As a user,** I want the app to be accessible and usable with a keyboard and screen reader.

## Functional Requirements

- **Task CRUD**: Users can create, read, update, delete, and archive tasks.
- **Task List**: Tasks are displayed in a list with completion status and notes. Users can use a single search input to filter tasks by name and description.
- **Task Details**: Users can view and edit details of a specific task.
- **Form Validation**: Task forms validate required fields and display errors.
- **Navigation**: Users can navigate between the task list, create, and edit views.
- **Loading States**: All async actions show loading indicators.
- **Error Handling**: Errors are caught and displayed to the user.
- **Notifications**: Success and error notifications are shown for user actions.
- **Persistence**: Tasks are persisted in localStorage.
- **Type Safety**: All logic and components use TypeScript interfaces and types.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Code splitting and lazy loading for route components
- **Responsiveness**: UI adapts to different screen sizes
- **Maintainability**: Modular file structure and clear separation of concerns
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% unit and integration test coverage
- **End-2-End(E2E) Test Coverage**: Coverage of all User Stories

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Provide sufficient color contrast and focus indicators
- Use accessible form controls and error messages

## Security

- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use HTTPS for all API calls (if/when backend is added)
- Implement proper CORS policies (if/when backend is added)

## Testing

- Unit tests for all utilities and components
- Component tests using React Testing Library and Vitest
- E2E tests for critical user flows using Playwright
- Continuous integration for automated test runs

## Out of Scope

- User authentication and multi-user support
- Backend API integration (future enhancement)
- Task sharing or collaboration features
